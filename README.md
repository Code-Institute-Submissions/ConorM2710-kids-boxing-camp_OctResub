## Features

### Navigation Bar
- The navigation bar is featured across all three pages of the site, the home page,Gallery and Sign Up. This allows for familiarity
  and simplicity so that the user can feel comfortable knowing that they can easily navigate throughout the site.
- Having the navigation bar on all three pages also allows for the user to use the navigation bar instead of the "back" arrow to 
  revert back to they're desired page.
- The navigation bar also holds the logo in the top left of the screen across all pages to once again establish consistency and 
  familiarity.


### Landing Page
- The Kool Kids Boxing Club landing page is designed to be memorable and exciting.
- The background image of a trainer and one of the camp students was too bright and did not contrast well with the brand so I added a linear gradient to mute the image slightly.
- The hero image also re-establishes what this camp is about by showcasing a kid and his boxing trainer.
- The landing page also utilises a sign up button so that the user can get straight to enrolling they're child if they do not wish to
  explore the rest of the site.
