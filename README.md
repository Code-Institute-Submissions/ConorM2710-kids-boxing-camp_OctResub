# Kool Kids Boxing Club

The Kool Kids website is a place to find out key information on what the summer camp entails and also provides a form so that 
the parents or guardians can enrol theyr'e children into the camp.

The users of this site will be able to find out the important and necessary information so that they can have peace of mind that
they're child will be safe, learning new skills and making friends. The target audience of this site is for parents who wish to 
enrol they're children into the summer camp.

## Features

### Navigation Bar
- The navigation bar is featured across all three pages of the site, the home page,Gallery and Sign Up. This allows for familiarity
  and simplicity so that the user can feel comfortable knowing that they can easily navigate throughout the site.
- Having the navigation bar on all three pages also allows for the user to use the navigation bar instead of the "back" arrow to 
  revert back to they're desired page.
- The navigation bar also holds the logo in the top left of the screen across all pages to once again establish consistency and 
  familiarity.

### Landing Page
- The Kool Kids Boxing Club landing page is designed to be memorable and exciting.
- The background image of a trainer and one of the camp students was too bright and did not contrast well with the brand so I added a linear gradient to mute the image slightly.
- The hero image also re-establishes what this camp is about by showcasing a kid and his boxing trainer.
- The landing page also utilises a sign up button so that the user can get straight to enrolling they're child if they do not wish to
  explore the rest of the site.

### What your kid will learn
- This section allows the parents or guradians see what their kid will learn over the course of the four week camp.

- The footer displays the social icons for the clubs social pages, all which are clickable links that open in a new tab.

### Sign Up Page
- The Sign Up page allows the parents or guardians to enroll the child into the summer camp through the simple form.
- The form asks for the age of the kid so that they can be sorted into appropriate age groups on the first day of the camp.

### Features left to implement
- With more time I would add a slideshow gallery effect as I believe it would allow for more interaction on the site while simultaneously
  condensing the images into a more digestible format.

## Testing
- I tested that this site works in different browsers.
- I have tested to ensure that the page is responsive for devices with different viewports, the elements of my site will collapse and change
  to allow for the decrease in screensize.
- I can confirm that the navigation, home, gallery and sign up page are all readable and also that my images contain alt text to allow for greater
  accessibility.
- The sign up page form also works as intended with the form notifying you if you have not filled in an area correctly.
- During the lighthouse testing which I conducted at the end of my project completeion I realised that the large image file sizes from pexels were slowing
  down my site greatly thus giving it a low performance score, for future projects I will ensure that the file sizes are reduced.

### Validator Testing
